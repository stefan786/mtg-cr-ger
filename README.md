Magic the Gathering - Comprehensive Rules in German

This is a repository for storing the german translation of the
Comprehensive Rules for the trading card game Magic the Gathering.

The main file holds the rulebook in a custom made light-weight markup
that was inspired by RestructuredText and similar "near text markup" formats
so that the file can be conveniently edited by several people at the same time.
